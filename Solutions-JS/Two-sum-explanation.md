## Two-sum-explanation
[Back to Explanations](./Explanations.md)


1. The function twoSum takes an array of integers (nums) and an integer (target) as parameters.

2. Inside the function, an empty object numIndices is created to store the indices of numbers in the array.

3. The function then iterates through the array using a for loop. For each number in the array, it calculates the complement (the number needed to reach the target).

4. It checks if the complement is already in the numIndices object. If it is, that means a pair of numbers is found, and it returns their indices.

5. If the complement is not found, it stores the current number and its index in the numIndices object.

6. If the loop completes without finding a solution, the function returns an empty array.

7. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample array and target, and it prints the result to the console.
